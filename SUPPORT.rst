Getting Support
===============

Remember to refer to the documentation, available on:

http://ka-lite.readthedocs.io/

To have help from other users, use our community support forum:

http://community.learningequality.org/

We do not accept support questions in Github issues, unless you think
your problem is due to an error in the project itself.
