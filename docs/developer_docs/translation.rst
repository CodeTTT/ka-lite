Translating KA Lite
===================

We release a "content pack" for a language once a sufficient portion of the
content (videos and user interface) have been translated.

There are two aspects to translation of KA Lite:

* Translating the KA content itself (dubbing videos, subtitling, and translating
  titles/descriptions). This is done
  `through Khan Academy <https://www.khanacademy.org/contribute>`__. Only videos
  that are included on official Khan Academy YouTube language channels, and
  mapped to their English counterparts in Khan Academy's API, will be included
  in KA Lite. 

* Translating the KA Lite interface text. For user interface translations, we
  use a website called CrowdIn. In order to contribute translations, follow the
  steps below: 

    1. Sign up for the
       `KA Lite Volunteer Translation Group <https://groups.google.com/a/learningequality.org/forum/#!forum/i18n>`__.
    2. Create an account on
       `CrowdIn <https://crowdin.net/project/ka-lite>`__, our online
       translations portal.
    3. Start contributing translations on CrowdIn! You will want to focus on the
       files for the version you're targeting -- for instance, to translate the
       strings for KA Lite 0.14, you should focus on translating strings in
       ``0.14-django.po`` and ``0.14-djangojs.po``.
